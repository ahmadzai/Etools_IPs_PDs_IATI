# Etools_IPs_PDs_IATI
R Script to download IPs/PDs information from eTools
## Before you run the code:
An `auth.R` file should be created inside `secret` directory with exact below variables:
```
BASE_URL <- "https:baseurl"   # storing the base_url of the eTools API
USER <- "useremail@official.org"   # user email (official email address)
PASS <- "PASSWORD"  #the password generated by eTools APIs, it is not the password of you email

```

Once you are done with the `auth.R` file, you can run `download_data.R` file, you can change some filters on the top of the `download_data.R` file e.g. `country_name`, `status_filter`. 

## Final note:
The downloaded data will be stored in `exports` directory, each run will generate two files `interventions_TIMESTAMP.csv` and `interventions_locations_TImESTAMP.csv`, the location file has the detail location information, and for each row in interventions file there will be one or more rows, you can connect both files using `id` column and other `ids` columns.
